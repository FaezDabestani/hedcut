1 - They use different definitions for a cell in voronoi grap.
	hedcutter defines with site and coverage, each pixel
	voronoi uses the edges and the bounds of the image to define cells
	
2 - Hedcutter has a GPU implementation, which calculates the voronoi graph using cones.

3 - Different ways of initial distribution:

improvements:

1- better starting approximation of the final image
2- considering the average case of point displacement instead of the largest displacement.
